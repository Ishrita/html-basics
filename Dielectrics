	<h1> Dielectrics Materials </h1>
	<p> DIELECTRIC- A dielectric (or an insulator) is
a material in which all the electrons are tightly
bound to the nuclei of the atoms.Thus there are
no free electrons to carry current. Hence the
electrical conductivity of a dielectric is very low.
(The conductivity of an ideal dielectric is zero).
Glass, plastic, mica, oil, etc., are examples of
dielectrics
<br>
<h3> Type of dielectric </h3>
<ol>
	<li> Polar dielectric </li>
	<li> Non-polar dielectric </li>
</ol>
Now, explaining polar and non-polar dielectric one by one , we get-
<ul> 
	<li>A NON-POLAR DIELECTRIC is one in which
the centre of gravity of the positive charges
(protons) coincides with the centre of gravity of
the negative charges (electrons). The non-polar molecules have symmetrical structure and zero electric dipole moment. Examples are: H2, N2, O2,
CO2, benzene, etc.</li>

<br>
<li> A POLAR DIELECTRIC is one in which the centre of gravity of
the positive charges is separated from the centre of gravity of
the negative charges by a finite distance. The polar molecule
is thus an electric dipole and has an intrinsic permanent
dipole moment. Examples are: H2O, HCl, CO, N2O, NH3, etc.</li>

<h3> Polarization of Dielectrics </h3>
<p>When a dielectric is placed in an external electric field E, the positive and negative charges are displaced from their
equilibrium positions by very small distances throughout the volume
of the dielectric. This results in the formation of a large number of
dipoles each having some dipole moment in the direction of the field.
The material is said to be polarized with a Polarization P.
The polarization P is defined as the dipole moment per unit
volume, averaged over the volume of a cell.</p>
<h3> Polarisation density </h3>
<p>Polarization density also describes how a material responds to an applied electric field as well as the way the material changes the electric field, and can be used to calculate the forces that result from those interactions. It can be compared to magnetization, which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to a magnetic field in magnetism. The SI unit of measure is coulombs per square meter, and polarization density is represented by a vector P</p>
